Graduation project: Monitoring Child Safety on School Buses Using Sensor Technology with a
Location-Based System -2024.

This project integrates real-time sensor data and GPS tracking technology to enhance child safety during school transportation. The system continuously monitors bus location and seat occupancy to identify potential safety risks, such as route deviations or children being left on buses. By sending timely alerts to parents and bus drivers, it creates a safer and more reliable transportation environment while providing peace of mind to families.

• Designed a system to enhance student safety on school buses using seat-detection sensors and real-
time alerts.

• Developed an application enabled parents to track their child’s location, Implemented a notification
system to alert parents when a child boards or exits the bus.


Key Stakeholders and Benefits
Children benefit from improved safety through constant monitoring, reducing risks related to unattended situations or unsafe conditions.
Parents receive real-time updates on their children’s location and status, ensuring reassurance during daily transportation.
Schools and Educational Institutions gain greater transparency and accountability by supervising transportation services and ensuring compliance with safety protocols, which strengthens parental trust.
Bus Drivers and Transportation Staff are supported by automated monitoring of bus conditions and seat occupancy, helping prevent safety incidents.
Technology and Service Providers benefit from new business opportunities, contributing to job creation and skill development within Oman’s technology sector, especially in IoT, data analytics, and smart transportation.

Operating Environment
The software component of the system was developed using Python as the primary programming language, with PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook as the development environment. The mobile application was built using Flutter and Dart, with Android Studio used for app development and testing.

Hardware Components
The hardware setup includes a Grove Infrared Reflective Sensor to detect seat occupancy, a Pi Camera for human detection, and a Raspberry Pi as the main controller. Additional components include a Grove GPS module for location tracking, Grove cables, an Elecrow 5-inch HDMI display, and a PC with at least 8GB RAM and an i7 processor.
